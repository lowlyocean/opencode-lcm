# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Migrated from OpenCode V1 plugin API to V2 (`Plugin.define`, `ctx.session.hook`, `ctx.tool.transform`, `ctx.event.subscribe`)
- Plugin config format changed from `"plugin"` to `"plugins"` in `opencode.json`
- Requires OpenCode ≥2.0; no longer compatible with OpenCode V1

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Locked in backward-compatibility coverage for pre-0.15.0 SQLite stores, including automatic schema-v1 and schema-v2 additive migrations with preserved live messages

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- `lcm_grep` offset pagination, summary-node scoping, and covering leaf-node annotations
- Deterministic JSON, CSV/TSV, SQL, and code exploration summaries for text file artifacts
- `lcm_status` recent hook-failure diagnostics and `lcm_doctor` managed resume-note drift repair
- Message tombstones with explicit `[removed]` and `[pruned: <id>]` expansion markers

### Changed
- The default summary strategy is now `deterministic-v3`, which condenses internal nodes from child digests instead of repeatedly summarizing the full raw span
- `lcm_expand` defaults to summary-only output; pass `includeRaw=true` for raw messages
- Snapshot import now requires an explicit `merge` or `replace` mode and preserves tombstones
- Interactive tools default to the invoking session; automatic recall uses FTS-only grep without substring scans
- SQLite transactions begin with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; retention, blob GC, close, and compaction perform WAL checkpoints

### Fixed
- Artifact IDs are deterministic and remain stable across identical part updates and session rewrites
- Snapshot imports validate referential closure and no longer overwrite existing content-addressed blobs
- Binary preview providers use bounded reads, and artifact FTS content is capped at 16,384 characters
- Deferred startup maintenance no longer blocks the first capture or prompt read
- Bun-on-Windows sidecar capture coalesces streaming part updates before RPC
- The headless OpenCode dogfood harness uses an async Windows launcher and a configurable five-minute timeout, avoiding `spawnSync` hangs during slow plugin startup
- Live SQLite corruption is quarantined and the triggering operation retried once; optional plugin hooks fail open so a corrupted store no longer blocks prompt submission ([#9](https://github.com/Plutarch01/opencode-lcm/issues/9))

### Removed
- Unused `interop.contextMode` and `interop.neverOverrideCompactionPrompt` options
- Dead retention SQL helpers that used blob creation time instead of `orphaned_at`

## [0.14.5] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `lcm_compact` previews database page/WAL usage, removes obsolete internal events, checkpoints WAL, and conditionally runs `VACUUM`
- `lcm_status` reports persisted corruption-recovery details and quarantined file locations
- `lcm_doctor` now runs SQLite integrity and foreign-key checks and validates event payloads precisely

### Fixed
- Corrupt SQLite databases are quarantined as a complete DB/WAL/SHM/journal set before a clean store is created
- Orphan blob retention now measures age from first observed orphaning instead of blob creation
- Sidecar timeouts terminate stuck workers, reject queued requests, and permit clean restart
- Store and sidecar shutdown flush deferred part updates and reject outstanding requests

## [0.14.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Biome lint: sorted imports and used optional chaining in `node-sidecar-store.ts`
- Biome format: wrapped long `rejectAll` call for line-length compliance

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Bun on Windows now keeps core archive/retrieval functionality by routing SQLite-backed work through a Node sidecar instead of loading SQLite in the Bun host process
- Config-only unsafe overrides no longer bypass the Bun/Windows sidecar; `OPENCODE_LCM_ALLOW_UNSAFE_BUN_WINDOWS=1` is reserved for deliberate in-process debugging

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- New `lcm_retrieval_debug` MCP tool surfaces the latest automatic-retrieval recall decision per session: status, query tokens, scope budgets, raw/selected hit counts, stop reason, and hit previews
- `lcm_status` now reports `db_bytes`, `wal_bytes`, `shm_bytes`, `total_bytes`, `prunable_events`, top-10 prunable event-type breakdowns, and FTS row counts (`message_fts`, `summary_fts`, `artifact_fts`)
- `StoreStats` type extended with storage-size, prunable-event, and FTS-index diagnostic fields

### Fixed
- Merged `fix/corrupted-json-row-loads-origin` branch: `readSessionSync`, `readMessageSync`, `readMessageSyncV2`, and grep scan paths now skip stored messages/parts with corrupted `info_json` or `part_json` instead of throwing
- `lcm_doctor` detects and reports malformed stored rows and orphaned message-fts entries

## [0.13.6] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Bun on Windows now leaves the plugin in a pre-SQLite safe mode by default and requires an explicit override to enable the full archive hooks

## [0.13.5] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Restored schema-v2 compatibility for persisted stores after the PR #6 merge
- Removed the unfinished `llm-cli` summary configuration surface before shipping it
- Restored Biome-clean formatting so the full cross-platform CI matrix passes again

## [0.13.4] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Publish validation now keeps the Bun-on-Windows lightweight capture regression test portable across non-Windows CI runners
- Republish the current malformed-message and Bun Windows capture fixes to npm after the failed 0.13.3 release check

## [0.13.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Bun on Windows now tolerates part-update capture when the parent message has not been materialized yet
- Additional malformed-message hardening now covers `message.info.time.created` reads and grep scan fallback paths
- Restored CI-clean formatting after the PR #5 merge so release validation and publish can complete

## [0.13.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Republish of 0.13.1 malformed-message hardening through CI with provenance

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Archive transform now removes malformed messages from the outbound message array before returning control to OpenCode, preventing follow-on backend `Bad Request` failures
- Archive, resume, describe, search indexing, and capture paths now skip malformed `message.info` metadata defensively instead of throwing when required fields are missing

### Added
- Opt-in `perf:archive` harness for large-archive regression coverage across transform, grep, snapshot, reopen, resume, and retention paths
- Separate advisory `Archive Performance` workflow for scheduled/manual perf runs with JSON artifact upload

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Cross-platform CI matrix for Linux, Windows, and macOS on Node 22 and 24
- Opt-in CI dogfood smoke job for the existing `dogfood:opencode` flow, including workflow-managed OpenCode CLI installation
- Privacy controls for excluding tool payloads, suppressing matching file-path capture, and redacting configured regex patterns before archive storage/indexing

### Changed
- `lcm_status` now reports configured privacy-control counts and excluded tool prefixes
- `tests/store.test.mjs` cleanup now retries transient Windows SQLite file-lock races
- Archived recall and summary reminders now use terse inline formatting and attach after the active user text instead of leading it
- Automatic-retrieval sanitization now strips archived reminder boilerplate before indexing and artifact externalization

### Fixed
- Pasted reminder text no longer pollutes retrieval candidates or dominates later archive recall

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Initial release of opencode-lcm plugin
- SQLite-based session storage with FTS5 full-text search
- Hierarchical summary graph for message archiving
- Artifact deduplication via content hashing
- Snapshot export/import for portable session data
- Automatic retrieval with TF-IDF query weighting
- Session lineage tracking (parent/child/root relationships)
- Retention policy enforcement (stale sessions, deleted sessions, orphan blobs)
- Resume notes for session continuation
- Doctor command for diagnosing and repairing store integrity
- Binary preview providers for file artifacts (image dimensions, PDF metadata, ZIP entries)
- Context-mode interop for sandboxed command execution
- Worktree-aware scoping for multi-workspace projects
- 141 tests covering core functionality
- `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking release history
- Direct regression coverage for scoped FTS refresh and snapshot replace-import stale-row cleanup

### Changed
- `parseJson()` now wraps errors with input preview and original message for easier debugging
- Silent `catch {}` blocks in `store-search.ts` replaced with `getLogger().debug()` logging
- Bun SQLite import replaced with direct `await import('bun:sqlite')` + ambient type declaration (`bun-sqlite.d.ts`)
- Duplicated artifact hydration switch/case extracted into `hydratePartFromArtifacts()` helper
- All manual `BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK` blocks replaced with `withTransaction()` helper
- Row type definitions unified — `store-snapshot.ts` is the canonical source
- `validateRow()` added to `sql-utils.ts` for runtime SQL result validation; applied to all `stats()` method queries
- Dead modules (`store-schema.ts`, `store-session-read.ts`) folded into `store.ts` as private functions with re-exports for test compatibility
- TF-IDF `filterTokensByTfidf()` doc-frequency ratio fixed to use actual `docFreq/totalDocs`
- `computeTfidfWeights()` return type extended with `docFreq` field
- `buildFtsQuery()` now preserves quoted phrases as FTS5 phrase clauses
- `resolveWorkspacePath()` absolute-path bypass fixed — absolute paths now validated against workspace root
- Duplicate `COUNT(*)` queries in TF-IDF eliminated — extracted `getTotalDocCount()` helper
- `importStoreSnapshot()` manual transaction replaced with `withTransaction()`
- Deduplicated `truncate()`, `shortNodeID()` from `archive-transform.ts` → imported from `utils.ts`
- Deduplicated `clamp()` from `store.ts` → imported from `utils.ts`
- Snapshot paths now support absolute paths (portable snapshots) and relative paths resolved from workspace with traversal guard
- `resolveWorkspacePath()` false-positive fix: names like `..hidden` no longer rejected
- Search index maintenance can now refresh only selected sessions instead of always rebuilding every FTS table
- Binary preview providers now use async file reads, and session/message externalization awaits preview generation before writing transactionally
- Test workspace cleanup now retries transient Windows SQLite file-lock races

### Fixed
- TF-IDF retrieval filtering bug where document frequency ratio was computed incorrectly
- Phrase query support broken in FTS5 — quoted strings now passed through as phrase clauses
- Workspace path security bypass where absolute paths skipped containment check
- Snapshot path resolution broke portable snapshot imports
- `store-retention.ts` module recreated after accidental deletion
- Snapshot replace-import left stale FTS rows behind for replaced sessions

### Security
- Fixed workspace path validation bypass that allowed absolute paths to escape the workspace root
- Added `validateRow()` runtime validation for all SQL query results in `stats()` method
